I am a 24 year old freelance writer from London, living in Australia. Since
graduating in my English Literature degree I have honed my analytical and
creative writing skills to pursue my interests in copywriting and digital
marketing. I have advanced a range of digital marketing campaigns for different
clients which have involved marketing research, strategy development and content
writing. When I’m not working, you’ll find me reading, writing and exploring.
I’m also crazy about health and fitness.

In my goal to continue to learn about marketing and enhance my writing, I would
love the opportunity to work with other creatives. If you’d like to know more
